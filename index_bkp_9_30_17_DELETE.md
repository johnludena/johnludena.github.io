## The birth of the "UX Developer"...
It's 2017 and designers everywhere are being expected to do more than ever before.

Not only are you supposed to be able to design a great user-interface in Sketch or Photoshop, but you also need to be able to have enough coding chops to bring a team's UX vision to life by coding those very mockups *before* they are handed off to the development team to turn into production-ready code.


## "But... being a great designer is hard enough!"
Not only are you supposed to understand what the client needs and translate those into a visual piece that fulfills a business' needs – great design is also part psychology, part marketing, all while keeping a business' goals in mind at all times during the design process.

Sure, you might know a bit of HTML & CSS. They are both "declarative" (or markup) languages, so whatever you write down *will* make something happen. There's no logic involved in the process. You write it. Stuff happens. Not too bad, right?

In other words: writing HTML & CSS makes *sense* for most designers.


## Writing Javascript on the other hand, makes *very* little sense.
And it's this final piece of becoming a "unicorn" that eludes you the most.

Every time you've tried to learn Javascript, either by taking a free coding course online, or by grabbing a "For Dummies" book, things start to get confusing very, *very* fast.

Not to mention, little of what's taught in all those Javascript books you've read seems to have PRACTICAL, real-world, use-it-tomorrow kind of appeal.

Variable scope, infinite for loops, and recursive functions?

Ugh. To quote the wise Sweet Brown: "Ain't nobody got time for that!"


## Actually, it's not your fault. Most Javascript courses today are simply not made with designers in mind.

Unfortunately, it's the truth. It seems every course out there today is more geared towards hard-core developers and aspiring software engineers than it is for designers.

And that's very different from how you *think*, how you *learn*, and how your brain *retains* information.

Designers are extremely visual after all. 

If you don't see *practical*, live demos explained in simple, easy-to-grasp concepts not necessarily geared for engineering minds – you'll never be able to learn enough fundamentals to help you out in a meaningful way in your real-world, everyday projects.


## A little about myself and my own Javascript epiphany
Hi, my name is John Ludena, and I'm a designer turned front-end developer. Some people call me a 'unicorn.' I call myself a designer who codes.

Learning Javascript as a designer has busted doors of opportunity wide open for me, more than DOUBLED my previous yearly income, and *truly* helped me turn my career and life around.

However, it wasn't easy. It took $14,000 and 12-weeks of learning the ins-and-outs of Javascript for an average of 10 hours every day at a coding bootcamp in my city.

And you know what I learned shortly after completing this bootcamp and getting a highly paid job afterwards? I only needed 20% of the stuff that I learned.

Yes, you read that right.

80% of the Javascript language mysteries and eccentricities (NaN is an *actual* number? Give me a freakin' break!) can be safely put to the side when you just want to learn some practical fundamentals to put to use right away in creating interactivity for your mockups and web projects.

It's a perfect example of the popular 80/20 principle at work. By learning only 20% of practical fundamentals, you will be able to code 80% of the most common UI/UX patterns today.


## Introducing a *practical* Javascript course with designers in mind
I can honestly tell you that making the decision to learn Javascript as a designer has been a game changer for me. It's been *the* catalyst to turn my career around and give me opportunities I never even *dreamed of*.

And now I want to do the same for you.

I'm currently working on a very special course specifically created with designers in mind. Do you want to know as soon as it's out? Submit your email below to be notified when it's released.

## Become the mythical 'unicorn' everybody is searching for.
* Imagine completely shattering the "earning ceiling" you thought you had as a designer...
* Imagine *having the option* to pick and choose which projects you want to work as a freelancer because you want to – and not *because you have to* just to make rent or pay bills...
* Imagine creating better bridges with developers, but at the same time having the ability to have a sound answer when you hear: "That can't be done..."
* Imagine bringing your desired user experience to life, without having to compromise on clunky and unresponsive UI's simply because you had to hand off your mockups to an inexperienced developer...
* Imagine becoming one of the *most* valuable team members – one who is not just another worker bee – but one who's opinions and thoughts on UI/UX are respected because you understand both sides of the user interface equation...


## Learning Javascript is not 'rocket surgery!'

Please don't make the same mistake I made by lying to yourself about never being able to learn a programming language like Javascript because you are not "wired" for it. I am here to tell you it *is* possible, you just don't know it yet. It's all about how you approach the material and start stacking those bricks until everything makes perfect sense.

If there was only ONE regret I have in my career today, is not learning Javascript YEARS ago.

But like the old Chinese proverb goes: "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."

So don't waste another month (or *gasp*... year!) not living up to your potential as a 'unicorn' designer who codes. Join the waiting list and get ready to change things around today.
